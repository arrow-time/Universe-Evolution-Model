# Universe Evolution Model

This document is based on a quantized elastic space model, which assumes that the universe was in a highly compressed state before the Big Bang, with spatial twistor potential energy concentrated in localized regions. 

After the Big Bang, the universe began to evolve, and the entire evolutionary process resembles a highly compressed elastic solid sphere, undergoing multiple phases: the conversion of the compressed state into expansion kinetic energyâ€”corresponding to the accelerating expansion stage, followed by decelerating expansion, accelerating contraction, decelerating contraction, and finally repeated oscillations until reaching thermal equilibrium. The spatial twistor potential energy was highly concentrated in a localized region before the Big Bang, consistent with the model of the initial low-entropy universe.

In this model, the compressed state couples with the space spinor and the fixed chirality spin of the Space Elementary Quanta (SEQ), leading to the formation of either mass or dark matter depending on the degree of compression and the characteristics of the space spinor. The anomalies observed in galaxy rotation curves are actually attributed to the residual effects of high-spin states that were essential for matter formation. 

Such a model aligns well with the major observed cosmological phenomena.
